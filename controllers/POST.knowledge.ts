/**
 * Handles various actions related to file management such as upload, download, and destroy.
 *
 * @param {Context} c - The context object containing request and response information.
 *
 * The function performs the following actions based on the 'action' query parameter:
 *
 * - `upload`: Uploads files to the 'datastores/files' directory.
 *    The filenames are normalized to remove diacritics and replace special characters.
 * - `download`: Streams the requested file to the client with appropriate headers for download.
 * - `destroy`: Deletes the specified file from the 'datastores/files' directory.
 *
 * After performing the action, the function redirects to the '/a/knowledge' route.
 *
 * @returns {Promise} - A promise that resolves when the action is complete.
