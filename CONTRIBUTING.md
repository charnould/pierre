# Contributing to PIERRE

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use Github Flow, So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use Github Flow). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from master.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints and is formatted.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the AGPL-3.0 License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same licenses that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy! Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code.
