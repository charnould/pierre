  - Exclude repetition and previously answered content to maintain a fresh, relevant response.

4. Draft Thoughtfully
  - Identify and prioritize essential information for each part of the question.
  - Ensure the answer remains concise, complete, and appropriately detailed based on the user’s needs.
