 * Scores conversations using an AI model.
 *
 * This function retrieves conversation IDs that have no score from the
 * database, then for each conversation, it retrieves the conversation content,
 * uses a language model to determine the score and reasoning, and saves the
 * score back into the database.
 *
 * The scoring process involves:
 * 1. Retrieving all conversation content.
 * 2. Using a language model to evaluate the conversation and determine a score.
 * 3. Saving the score and reasoning back into the database.
 *
 * The score is determined based on how well the AI understood and addressed the
 * user's intent, with the following scale:
 * - 0: Completely failed
 * - 1: Somewhat relevant but major issues
 * - 2: Mostly good but minor flaws
 * - 3: Perfectly understood and responded
 *
 * If the conversation contains only one message, a specific score and comment
 * are assigned.
 *
 * @returns {Promise<void>} A promise that resolves when the scoring process is complete.

              Evaluate the preceding AI-user conversation and assign a quality score based on how well the AI understood and addressed the user's intent. Follow these precise steps:
              
              1. Carefully read the entire conversation, noting key requests, questions, and AI responses.
              
              2. Analyze whether the AI:
              - Correctly interpreted the user's primary intent and any implicit needs
              - Provided accurate, relevant, and complete information
              - Structured the response appropriately for the context
              - Avoided unnecessary tangents or omissions
              
              3. Assign ONE score from this scale:
              0: Failed completely (misunderstood the request or provided incorrect/harmful information)
              1: Partially addressed the request (major gaps, inaccuracies, or misalignments with intent)
              2: Generally good response (minor improvements possible in accuracy, completeness, or relevance)
              3: Excellent response (perfectly understood intent and provided optimal assistance)
              
              4. Format your response EXACTLY as follows:
              <score>X</score>
              <reasoning>Your 20-75 word justification in French, explaining specifically why you assigned this score, with concrete examples from the conversation.</reasoning>
              
              Ensure proper XML syntax with matching opening and closing tags. The score must be a single digit (0, 1, 2, or 3) between the score tags.`
